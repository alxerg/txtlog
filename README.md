### `txtlog`

`txtlog` is a simple script to store notes and journal entries in plain ol' `.txt` files. The tool is highly opinionated, and I may not merge patches that don't suit my usecase. You're highly encouraged to maintain a personal fork; it's MIT licensed.

#### Usage

`txtlog` supports three commands: `list`, `new`, and `edit`. The three stand are fairly descriptive of what they do; `list` lists entries, `new` creates new entries, and `edit` edits previously written entries.

See `txtlog help` for more details. You can run `txtlog help COMMAND` to know more about `COMMAND`. For example, run `txtlog help new` to know more about the `new` command.
